# Ratings & Recipes: Food Clash-Off!

### Introduction

Being the big foodie that I am, I love trying various food and enjoying new cuisines! From my mother's food to American food, I've seen how food differs from culture to culture -- it's one of the most fun experiences I'll always treasure. When I saw how Icould analyze data about food in many ways, I immediately knew that I was entering a flavorful world! I went to look into the dataset and I found that there are ***so*** many factors to consider when determining how ratings/cost are calculated. The further I looked into the dataset and each recipe's ratings, I found that cooking times are influential to how well a recipe truly is but I wasn't fully sure. The question that I researched furthered into is: "**Do characteristics like higher cooking times (minutes) lead to highly-rated recipes (e.g., rating >= 4.0)?**" Understanding the answer to this question will make us care about the recipes in various perspectives. For example, from the mind of home cooks and recipe developers, they might want to take the findings from this study so that they can prioritize specific factors (e.g., fewer steps or ingredients) to make appealing recipes. There's also the food platforms like food.com (the ones who posted this dataset) who publish recipes that might be tailored to user preferences and boosting their user engagement as a result.
